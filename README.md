# lastdisconnected

Hello today i made a plugin wich says the SteamIds and names of the last Disconnected players! I think its very cool because if i want to report 
someone on maybe some forums and he leave instantly i can just type sm_disconnected and it will show me last 10 disconnected players!
 And you need multi colors from Bara : to make the plugin work https://github.com/Bara/Multi-Colors
so the commands :
sm_disconnected

Also big credits to : Headline for making the Ban Disconnected plugin
