My OWN SM plugin


Hello today i made a plugin wich says the SteamIds and names of the last Disconnected players! I think its very cool because if i want to report 
someone on maybe some forums and he leave instantly he can just type sm_disconnected and it will show me last 10 disconnected players!

so the commands :
sm_disconnected
